        <p>I developed a completely customized e-commerce/shopping cart application from scratch using Django and React.
            This project, PROSHOP.COM, features a full-fledged shopping cart, product views with ratings, user profiles
            with order histories, and comprehensive admin product management along with detailed admin order pages.</p>

        <p>The application was built using React with functional components and hooks, integrated with React Router for
            seamless navigation, and styled using the React Bootstrap UI library. I managed the global state with Redux,
            employing actions and reducers, and used React state management techniques such as useDispatch and
            useSelector to ensure efficient state handling. The backend was powered by Django and PostgreSQL, ensuring
            robust data management and security.</p>
